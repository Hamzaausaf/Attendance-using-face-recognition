This project implements a Attendance System Using Face Recognition using Python and various machine learning libraries. It automates the process of marking attendance by recognizing faces in real-time or through pre-recorded images or videos. The system is efficient, secure, and user-friendly, making it ideal for schools, colleges, offices, and other organizations.

Features
Face Detection and Recognition:
Utilizes advanced algorithms to detect and recognize faces with high accuracy.
Real-Time Attendance:
Capture faces in real-time using a webcam or camera feed to mark attendance.
Image and Video Support:
Allows attendance marking from pre-captured images or video files.
Database Management:
Stores attendance records securely in a database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL).
Interactive GUI:
Includes a simple and interactive interface for administrators and users.
Notification System:
Sends notifications (e.g., email) for attendance reports or irregularities.
Scalability:
Can handle multiple users efficiently with the ability to update face records dynamically.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries and Tools:
OpenCV: For face detection and processing
dlib: For facial feature extraction
face-recognition: For identifying registered users
Pandas: For data handling and analysis
Numpy: For numerical operations
Tkinter or PyQt: For GUI development (optional)
Database: SQLite/MySQL for storing user and attendance data
How It Works
Register Faces:
Register a user's face and save their information in the database.
Capture Input:
Capture input via webcam, video, or image files.
Face Matching:
Compare detected faces with registered faces using the face-recognition library.
Mark Attendance:
Record the recognized user's attendance in the database with a timestamp.
Generate Reports:
Generate and export attendance reports in CSV or Excel formats.
